"""
For this exercise, we want you to code a generic superclass and at least three
subclasses of that superclass, each class needs to have at least 2 attributes and 2 methods.
Itâ€™s easiest to simply describe a real-world object in this manner.
You need to provide a test method that shows your classes in operation.
